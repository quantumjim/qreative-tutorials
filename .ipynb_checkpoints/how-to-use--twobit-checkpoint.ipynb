The noise in real devices could lead to the wrong output being returned with a small probability. Some mitigation is done to make this less likely. This can be turned off by setting the `mitigate=True` qwarg to `False`. The remaning kwarg is `shots=1024`, which essentially does nothing for simulated noiseless runs. For real devices (or simulated noise) large values of `shots` (such as 1024) allow the mitigation to work better than for smaller values. At the extreme of `shots=1`, the mitigation becomes powerless.\n",

So this object should really be called `three_bit`. But it's not, because everyone always ignores poor `Y`."
